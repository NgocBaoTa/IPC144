1. - Use code blocks (curly braces) even for single-line statements in the 
iteration parts to make sure that dangling else doesn't appear
- Use spacing and indentation (consistent throughout my code) especially for 
nested constructs

2. I don't think that this workshop can be done without nesting because 
loops and conditions depend on each other and also the user's inputs
In case nesting is not possible, we can not control the flow of code 
Ex: compiler doesn't know that the loops should be run in which cases or 
when the loops should stop  

3. - Using a series of "if" statements is inefficient because the program 
will have to evaluate all of the conditions, even if a previous condition 
has already been true => slow down the performance.

- On the other hand, the "if/else if..." statements only have to be excuted 
until one is found to be true, and the rest of the conditions will not be 
excuted => a more efficient and optimized execution of the program.
