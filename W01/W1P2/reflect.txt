1. Yes, I have some experience in JavaScript but just for nearly 1 year. 
This is the first time I learn and write code in C.

2. Compiling process is transforming source code writing in human-readable 
language (C language) into machine language. We run C text file (source code)
and receive output on the screen.

3. After this course, I hope that I can understand the fundamentals of C, 
have at least one group project and I can write my own project in C. Moreover, 
after learning C, hopefully, C will be the base that can help me learn other 
programming languages easier.
