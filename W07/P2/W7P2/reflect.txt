1. I was successful in coding non-repetitive sections of logic in the game 
play portion of this workshop by using loops and conditions
e.g. drawing of the ruler: I used for loop since we know the number of needed 
loops and inside the loop, I used condition to check whether loop counter % 10
is equal to 0 to printf the 1st number in every 10 positions.

2. Structures help in simplifying a program by allowing related data to be 
grouped together => making the code more organized and easier to maintain
Instead of creating many individual variables, arrays and parallel arrays to 
store data, structure makes the code more readable and easier to represent 
complex data types.

3.
do {
	for (p = 0; p < game.pathLength; p++) {
      	if (player.history[p] == 0) {
            }
            else {
                if (game.bombs[p] == 1 && game.treasure[p] == 1) {
                }
            }
        }
    } while (player.lives >= 0 && game.moves >= 0 && flag == 0);
